Web-site I created in 2010., it presents online web-shop for sports equipment shop. It was supposed to be a show-case for content management system I wrote and called it Lightweight Content Management. LCM supports multi-language versions, article-groups, articles, web-shop with product-groups and products, management of product orders. There is public and private part of the website as with every CMS. It is written using PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Zend framework.
